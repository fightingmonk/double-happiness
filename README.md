Welcome to Double Happiness!

This is an eternally in-the-works API-based social network with a "browser console" interface.

To run your own, add the dhapi Django app to a Django project, 
integrate the /api/ url mappings from urls.py into your project, 
make sure the static files in dhui/ are available via your front-end httpd, 
and go to town.

For real Double Happiness, ensure your server has a copy of 'jp2a' installed for
ASCII art rendering.
